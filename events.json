    "description": " A nativity scene is a spontaneous creation which represents the birth of Jesus Christ, and has become an icon of Christmas in Madeira. While some maintain this tradition, others modernize it. Natural material is usually used, or any other which is available, in the setting up of the traditional lapinha / nativity scene, in the form of a staircase or paper imitating a rocky grotto, yet all different as they result from the creativity of each creator, influenced by the environment where they live.  Around the island there are nativity scenes which are true works of art and open to the public for visits. ",
